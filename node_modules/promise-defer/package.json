It used to exist in browsers and JavaScript engines as\n`Promise.defer`, but was later deprecated. It's still useful in some cases.\n\nPromiseDefer.js uses the **native ES6 `Promise` by default**, but you can pass\nit another **Promises/A+ compatible** constructor function.\n\n[deferred]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Promise.jsm/Deferred\n[promisesa+]: https://promisesaplus.com/\n\n\nInstalling\n----------\n```sh\nnpm install promise-defer\n```\n\nPromiseDefer.js follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), so feel\nfree to depend on its major version with something like `>= 1.0.0 < 2`\n(a.k.a `^1.0.0`).\n\n\nUsing\n-----\n```javascript\nvar defer = require(\"promise-defer\")\n\nvar deferred = defer()\ndeferred.resolve(42)\ndeferred.promise // Will eventually be resolved with 42.\n\nvar rejection = defer()\nrejection.reject(new Error(\"I'll have none of that, thank you.\"))\nrejection.promise // Will eventually be rejected with the error.\n```\n\nPromiseDefer.js will use the global ES6 `Promise` constructor by default that's\nstarting to become available in browsers and JavaScript runtimes (e.g. the V8 in\nNode.js v0.11). It doesn't therefore have any outside dependencies.\n\n### Using another Promise implementation\nIf you'd like to use another promise implementation or are running in an\nenvironment that doesn't have the native `Promise`, pass\na [Promises/A+][promisesa+] compatible constructor as the first argument:\n\n```javascript\nvar Bluebird = require(\"bluebird\")\nvar defer = require(\"promise-defer\").bind(null, Bluebird)\ndefer().promise // => An instance of Bluebird.\n```\n\n### Deferred class\nIf you need to programmatically differentiate beteween regular objects and\n`Deferred` instances, use the `instanceof` operator:\n\n```javascript\nvar Deferred = require(\"promise-defer\")\nDeferred() instanceof Deferred // => true\n```\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nPromiseDefer.js is released under a *Lesser GNU Affero General Public License*,\nwhich in summary means:\n\n- You **can** use this program for **no cost**.\n- You **can** use this program for **both personal and commercial reasons**.\n- You **do not have to share your own program's code** which uses this program.\n- You **have to share modifications** (e.g. bug-fixes) you've made to this\n  program.\n\nFor more convoluted language, see the `LICENSE` file.\n\n\nAbout\n-----\n**[Andri Möll][moll]** typed this and the code.  \n[Monday Calendar][monday] supported the engineering work.\n\nIf you find PromiseDefer.js needs improving, please don't hesitate to type to me\nnow at [andri@dot.ee][email] or [create an issue online][issues].\n\n[email]: mailto:andri@dot.ee\n[issues]: https://github.com/moll/js-promise-defer/issues\n[moll]: http://themoll.com\n[monday]: https://mondayapp.com\n",
